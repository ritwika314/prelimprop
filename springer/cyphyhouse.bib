    abstract = {Typically platform specific programming models for distributed Cyber-Physical Systems provide limited portability, code reuse, rigorous verification, and synthesis. Koord is a new distributed CPS programming model and language, which treats the platform-independent decision and coordination tasks as a separate concern from platform-dependent concerns of low-level sensing, communication, and control. Koord features event-based programming, shared variables for convenient coordination across multiple agents, and interfaces defined by sensor and actuator ports for the (platform independent) application program to interface with program's environment consisting of controllers and the physical plant. We implement the executable semantics of Koord in the {\textbackslash}K framework. The Koord framework also includes formal analysis tools on top of the semantics to enable semantics driven-verification.},

	abstract = {Safety verification of embedded systems modeled as hybrid
	systems can be scaled up by employing simulation-guided
	reach set over-approximation techniques. Existing methods
	are either applicable to only restricted classes of systems,
	overly conservative, or computationally expensive. We
	present new techniques to compute a locally optimal bloating
	factor based on discrepancy functions, which allow construction
	of reach set over-approximations from simulation
	traces for general nonlinear systems. The discrepancy functions
	are critical for tools like C2E2 to verify bounded time
	safety properties for complex hybrid systems with nonlinear
	continuous dynamics. The new discrepancy function is
	computed using local bounds on a matrix measure under
	an optimal metric such that the exponential change rate of
	the discrepancy function is minimized. The new technique is
	less time consuming and less conservative than existing techniques
	and does not incur significant computational overhead.
	We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
	comparing the performance of a prototype implementation
	with the state-of-the-art reachability analysis tool Flow*.},
